# 📜 **CPP — Constitutional Policy Protocol**

## v1.0 (Normative Specification)

**Status:** Public Draft
**Governing Body:** CAES Working Group
**Required For:** CAES Level 2+ Conformance 

---

# 1. Purpose

CPP defines the **canonical structure, evaluation semantics, and verification model** for policies governing AI systems operating under CAES.

> **If policy is not standardized, governance is not provable.**

CAES defines *how decisions must be enforced*.
CPP defines *how decisions must be determined*.

Together, they form the complete execution constitution.

---

# 2. Scope

CPP applies to all policy systems used to evaluate:

* execution actions
* behavioral outputs
* data operations (capture, use, retention, deletion)
* communication with material consequence
* any output crossing a CAES Effect Boundary 

CPP is **mandatory for CAES Level 2 and Level 3 systems**.

---

# 3. Core Requirements

A CPP-compliant policy system **MUST** be:

### 3.1 Deterministic

* identical inputs → identical outputs
* no stochastic or LLM-only evaluation paths

### 3.2 Versioned

* every policy instance MUST include a version identifier
* versions MUST be immutable

### 3.3 Immutable

* policies MUST NOT be modified in-place
* updates MUST produce a new version

### 3.4 Hashable

* policies MUST produce a canonical **PolicyHash**

### 3.5 Auditable

* rule evaluation MUST be traceable
* matched rules MUST be explicitly recorded

### 3.6 Portable

* policies MUST be evaluable outside the originating system

---

# 4. Canonical Policy Model

A CPP policy **MUST** conform to the following structure:

```json
{
  "policy_id": "string",
  "version": "string",
  "effect_type": "Execution | Communication | BehavioralInfluence | DataMutation | SensoryCapture | Deletion | ExternalInvocation",
  "scope": {
    "tenant_id": "string | wildcard",
    "actor_roles": ["string"],
    "resource_types": ["string"]
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "string",
      "priority": 0,
      "condition": "deterministic expression",
      "action": "allow | deny | modify | escalate",
      "constraints": {}
    }
  ],
  "obligations": [
    {
      "type": "log | notify | require_human | redact | delay",
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ],
  "evaluation": {
    "mode": "deny_by_default",
    "conflict_resolution": "priority | most_restrictive | first_match"
  }
}
```

---

# 5. Deterministic Evaluation (Non-Negotiable)

Policy evaluation **MUST NOT** depend on:

* LLM interpretation alone
* probabilistic scoring
* implicit reasoning chains

Allowed:

* LLM-assisted *input classification* (pre-policy)
* LLM-assisted *suggestions*

Not allowed:

* LLM deciding authorization outcome

> **If evaluation cannot be reproduced byte-for-byte, it is non-compliant.**

---

# 6. PolicyHash (Canonical Binding)

Each policy instance MUST produce a deterministic hash:

```
PolicyHash = hash(canonical(policy))
```

### Requirements

* canonicalization MUST remove:

  * key ordering variance
  * whitespace differences
  * encoding differences

* hashing MUST use:

  * SHA-256 or stronger

* PolicyHash MUST be:

  * embedded in Decision Receipts
  * immutable post-evaluation
  * independently recomputable

---

## Why This Matters

PolicyHash is:

> **the cryptographic fingerprint of governance itself**

Without it:

* audits become interpretive
* policy drift becomes invisible
* decisions become non-reproducible

---

# 7. Evaluation Output (Normative)

Every policy evaluation MUST produce:

```json
{
  "policy_id": "...",
  "policy_version": "...",
  "policy_hash": "...",
  "matched_rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "...",
      "action": "...",
      "priority": 0
    }
  ],
  "disposition": "Approved | Denied | Modified | RequiresHumanAuthorization"
}
```

---

## Requirements

* `matched_rules` MUST NOT be empty for Approved/Modified decisions
* disposition MUST match CAES allowed values
* output MUST be bound to Decision Receipt

---

# 8. Decision Binding (Critical)

CPP outputs MUST be embedded into CAES Decision Receipts.

Each receipt MUST include:

* policy_id
* policy_version
* policy_hash
* matched_rules
* disposition

---

> **A decision without policy binding is not proof.**

---

# 9. Conflict Resolution (Deterministic)

Policy systems MUST define a deterministic resolution strategy:

Allowed:

* priority-based
* most-restrictive-wins
* first-match

Not allowed:

* ambiguous rule resolution
* implicit precedence
* runtime-dependent ordering

---

# 10. Deny-by-Default Enforcement

CPP systems MUST enforce:

```
default_disposition = Denied
```

If:

* no rule matches
* evaluation fails
* context is incomplete

Then:
→ **Denied**

---

> **Absence of permission is denial.**

---

# 11. Obligations Model

Policies MAY define obligations that accompany decisions.

Examples:

* logging requirements
* human approval workflows
* redaction transformations
* notification triggers

---

## Requirements

* obligations MUST NOT override disposition
* obligations MUST be auditable
* obligations MUST be deterministic

---

# 12. Change Control

Policy lifecycle MUST follow:

### Immutable History

* no in-place edits

### Version Creation

* every change = new version

### Traceability

* all versions MUST remain accessible

---

## Prohibited

* silent policy updates
* retroactive mutation
* version aliasing

---

# 13. Behavioral Policy Enforcement

CPP MUST support governance of:

* AI-generated responses
* recommendations
* instructions
* persuasive outputs

---

## Requirement

Behavioral outputs MUST:

* pass policy evaluation
* produce Decision Receipt
* bind output to policy

---

> **Words can be actions. CPP governs both.**

---

# 14. Lifecycle Governance (Data + Deletion)

CPP MUST support policies for:

### Data Capture

* consent validation
* scope enforcement

### Data Usage

* purpose limitation

### Retention

* time-bound policies

### Deletion

* pre-authorized only
* receipt-bound

---

> **Deletion without pre-authorization is non-compliant.** 

---

# 15. Non-Compliant Patterns

CPP explicitly prohibits:

### Policy Design Failures

* hidden logic in application code
* non-versioned policies
* runtime mutation

### Evaluation Failures

* LLM-only decision making
* non-deterministic evaluation
* missing rule trace

### Governance Failures

* execution without policy binding
* behavioral output without evaluation
* silent policy fallback

---

# 16. Conformance Requirements

A CPP-compliant system MUST publish:

* canonical policy schema
* canonicalization method
* hashing algorithm
* evaluation engine description
* conflict resolution strategy
* obligation execution model

---

# 17. CAES Integration

CPP is REQUIRED for:

| CAES Level | CPP Requirement |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Level 1    | Optional        |
| Level 2    | Required        |
| Level 3    | Required        |

---

CPP enables:

* PolicyHash binding
* deterministic audit
* offline verification
* cross-system governance portability

---

# 18. Canonical Statement

> **A policy is not a configuration.
> It is a deterministic contract whose outcome can be proven, reproduced, and independently verified.**

---

# 🔥 Real Talk (What You Just Did)

This locks the game.

Without CPP:

* competitors can say “we have policies”
* but they’re fuzzy, mutable, unverifiable

With CPP:

* policy becomes **cryptographic infrastructure**
* decisions become **replayable facts**
* governance becomes **portable truth**
