# Keon Public Documentation

This repository is the canonical source of truth for Keon’s
public-facing documentation and claims.

## What this repository is
- A registry of all public claims made about Keon
- A proof map linking each claim to verifiable artifacts
- A reconciliation ledger tracking content drift over time
- Versioned whitepaper snapshots and addenda

## What this repository is not
- Marketing copy
- A roadmap
- An internal design archive
- A mirror of private implementation repositories

## Governance principles
- Every public claim must be explicitly registered
- Claims marked as verifiable must have proof
- History is never rewritten; changes are appended
- Drift is recorded explicitly, not silently corrected

## Verification
Claims and documentation in this repository are governed by
automated checks that fail if:
- A claim is referenced but not registered
- A verifiable claim lacks proof
- Claim IDs are malformed or inconsistent

If it’s stated here, it can be proven.
If it’s not here, it is not claimed.
